00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
Alright, let's dive in. Today we're talking about a brand new research project that's

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.180
aimed at cracking one of the toughest, most expensive problems in the business world.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.660
I mean, we've all seen this happen, right? A company sinks millions into some shiny new

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:21.900
system, a new platform, a set of tools, and it just fizzles. It gets bogged down, people

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.760
resist it, and it never quite delivers on that big promise. It's a massive, frustrating

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.720
issue that hits pretty much every organization out there. And let's be clear, the stakes here

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.060
are incredibly high. As Clark Moyer, who's leading this project, puts it,

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.480
this isn't just about wasted cash. When you fail to adopt new tech, you risk losing your

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.760
competitive edge. And in the worst-case scenario, you could become obsolete. Now, you might be

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.900
thinking, haven't people studied this for years? And yeah, they have. But here's the thing. A lot

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.660
of that research is siloed, or it just doesn't capture the big-picture view from the senior

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.980
leaders who are actually making these multi-million-dollar calls. There's a huge blind spot in our

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.560
understanding. So if the old playbooks aren't cutting it anymore, how do you actually design

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.200
something that gets to the real root of the problem? You go straight to the source. The

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.940
TABS Project hones in on the C-suite and the senior execs, you know, the CEOs, the CIOs,

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.140
the folks who have that 30,000-foot view of everything happening in their organization.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.560
And this is the tool they built to do it.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.580
It's called the Technology Adoption Barrier Survey, or TABs for short.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.680
It's a new diagnostic specifically designed to pull out those high-level insights

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.660
and really map out what's going on.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.120
Okay, so let's pop the hood on this thing.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.060
How does this survey actually dig in and uncover these insights?

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.200
Well, it's all broken down into a three-part diagnostic.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.540
To really get the full picture, it deconstructs the problem into three logical chunks.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.560
First, you've got to pinpoint the actual barriers.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.240
Next, you assess how ready the organization is for the change.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.200
And finally, you measure the maturity of the company's core processes.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:05.920
Let's dig into each one.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.780
Part one is all about finding the roadblocks.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.240
It gets leaders to rate all those classic hurdles.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.540
You know the ones.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.100
Employees digging their heels in.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.880
The sticker shock of the new tech.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.640
The nightmare of making it play nice with your old systems, or maybe it's something bigger like

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.420
nobody even knows what the strategy is. These are the pain points we all recognize. But you know

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:35.100
just spotting the problems isn't enough. Part two is all about readiness. Is your organization

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.660
actually set up to handle this change? Is the vision from the top crystal clear? Is your culture

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.780
open to trying new things? Do you have the right people with the right skills? This part is

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.600
basically a checkup on your capacity for success. And this brings us to the third and maybe the most

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:57.900
powerful part, measuring maturity. This goes way deeper than readiness. It asks leaders to rate

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.320
their organization's processes on this five-level scale. Are you at level one where everything is

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:08.280
kind of chaotic and reactive? Or are you all the way up at level five where you're proactively

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:14.020
innovating and always improving? This really gets to the heart of how ingrained your good habits

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:20.220
are. Now, a tool this ambitious can't just appear out of thin air, right? It needs to be built on

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:26.740
something solid. And the TABS project is absolutely built on a mountain of foundational research.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:33.260
This is what's so important to understand. The TABs survey isn't just some random checklist

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:40.780
someone dreamed up. It's the end results of over 60 years of deep academic work on how people

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.240
and, by extension, entire organizations adopt new stuff.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.600
You can literally trace the family tree of these ideas.

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.840
It started way back in the 60s with the diffusion of innovations theory.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.280
Then, in the 80s, we got the technology acceptance model,

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.500
which focused on whether people thought something was useful and easy.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.380
The unified theory in 2003 pulled a bunch of these

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.900
ideas together. And now, TABs is taking all of that

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.560
and turning it into a practical, modern tool for today's leaders.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.260
So we've got all this history, all this research.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.120
But what's the point of collecting all this data?

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.140
Well, the goal isn't just to write another paper.

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:24.240
It's to turn all of that data into insights you can actually use.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.760
Yeah, the whole project was built from the very beginning

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.180
to have practical, real-world value.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.980
It's all about closing that gap between a dusty academic theory

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.960
and the tough decisions leaders have to make every single day.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.280
So what's the big payoff?

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:39.940
Well, it's huge.

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:45.420
For starters, it's going to give you industry benchmarks so you can finally see how you stack up.

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.340
It'll help leaders zero in on exactly where they need to focus their attention.

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.280
And because they plan to do this every year,

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.340
it will create this amazing GPS for navigating change,

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.180
spotting trends, and helping everyone build more adaptive, innovative cultures.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.900
Alright, so let's make this personal for a second.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.960
Let's turn the camera around and think about what's going on in your own organization.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:14.420
You know, the real power of a survey like this is in the questions it forces you to ask.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.920
So think about it for your own company.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.140
To what extent is a play-it-safe, risk-averse culture holding you back?

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.620
And be honest, how mature is your ability to handle the human side of change?

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.200
Just thinking through these questions is valuable.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.560
And that really brings us to the final bottom line question.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.120
Let's just cut through all the noise for a second.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:42.260
In your world, at your company, what is the single biggest barrier holding you back?

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.840
Is it the tech, the money, the culture, the leadership?

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.480
Because answering that, that's the first real step to actually fixing it.

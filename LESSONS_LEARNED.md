## What Worked Well

### 1. Mobile-First Responsive Design

**Decision**: Use Tailwind CSS with mobile-first approach

**Outcome**: ✅ Excellent

**Why it worked**:

- Components naturally scale across devices
- Fewer CSS overrides needed
- Better performance on mobile devices
- Cleaner, more maintainable code

**Lesson**: Always start with mobile constraints and enhance for larger screens.

### 2. Static Site Generation (Next.js Export)

**Decision**: Use Next.js static export for GitHub Pages deployment

**Outcome**: ✅ Excellent

**Why it worked**:

- Free hosting on GitHub Pages
- Fast page loads (pre-rendered HTML)
- No server infrastructure needed
- Easy deployment via GitHub Actions
- Works perfectly for content-heavy sites

**Lesson**: Static generation is ideal for marketing sites with infrequent content changes.

### 3. Component-Based Architecture

**Decision**: Break UI into small, reusable components

**Outcome**: ✅ Very Good

**Why it worked**:

- Easy to test individual components
- Reusable across pages
- Easier to maintain
- Clear separation of concerns

**Current Stats**:

- 112 component files
- Well-organized in `/src/components/`
- Each component has single responsibility

**Lesson**: Small, focused components are easier to test, maintain, and reuse.

### 4. Pre-commit Hooks with Husky

**Decision**: Automatically run linting and formatting before commits

**Outcome**: ✅ Excellent

**Why it worked**:

- Prevents bad code from being committed
- Ensures consistent code style
- Catches errors early
- Reduces code review overhead

**Lesson**: Automated quality checks at commit time save significant review time.

### 5. Conventional Commits

**Decision**: Enforce conventional commit messages with Commitlint

**Outcome**: ✅ Very Good

**Why it worked**:

- Clean, readable git history
- Easy to generate changelogs
- Clear commit categorization (feat, fix, docs, etc.)
- Better understanding of project evolution

**Example**:

```
feat: add dark mode toggle component
fix: resolve cookie consent banner positioning
docs: update README with new deployment instructions
```

**Lesson**: Structured commit messages are worth the initial learning curve.

### 6. Comprehensive Documentation

**Decision**: Create extensive documentation suite

**Outcome**: ✅ Excellent

**Files Created**:

- README.md
- CONTRIBUTING.md
- TESTING.md
- CODE_QUALITY.md
- DEPLOYMENT.md
- SECURITY.md
- ISSUE_RESOLUTION.md
- LIGHTHOUSE.md
- RESPONSIVE_DESIGN.md
- QUICK_START.md
- LESSONS_LEARNED.md

**Why it worked**:

- Reduces onboarding time for new contributors
- Self-service troubleshooting
- Clear standards and expectations
- Institutional knowledge preserved

**Lesson**: Documentation investment pays dividends in reduced support burden.

## What Didn't Work

### 1. Using `<img>` Instead of Next.js `<Image>`

**Decision**: Use native `<img>` tags instead of Next.js `<Image>` component

**Outcome**: ⚠️ Mixed Results

**Why it was necessary**:

- Next.js `<Image>` doesn't work well with static export
- GitHub Pages deployment requires special asset path handling
- Created `assetPath()` helper as workaround

**Downsides**:

- ESLint warnings on every build
- No automatic image optimization
- Manual srcset management needed
- Larger bundle sizes for images

**Lesson**: Static export has trade-offs. Document them clearly.

**Future Consideration**: Explore Next.js 15+ improvements for static image optimization.

### 2. Internal Navigation with Next.js Static Export

**Decision**: Use Next.js static export without server-side routing

**Outcome**: ⚠️ Requires Workarounds

**Issues**:

- Links like `/about-us` work in browser but fail link validation
- Files generated as `/about-us.html` but hrefs don't include `.html`
- Linkinator reports 404s for valid routes
- Requires server configuration or GitHub Pages handling

**Workarounds**:

- Document expected link checker behavior
- Skip internal route patterns in Linkinator config
- Trust GitHub Pages to handle routing correctly

**Lesson**: Static export is great but requires understanding of its limitations.

### 3. Test Coverage Thresholds

**Decision**: Start with low test coverage thresholds (5%)

**Outcome**: ⚠️ Needs Improvement

**Why it's problematic**:

- 5% coverage is very low
- Doesn't enforce meaningful testing
- Many components remain untested

**Current Stats**:

- 25 tests passing
- ~5% code coverage
- Critical components tested (Header, Footer, Cookie Consent)

**Plan**:

- Gradually increase thresholds
- Target 50%+ coverage over time
- Focus on high-risk components first

**Lesson**: Start with achievable thresholds but set clear goals for improvement.

### 4. React Testing Library `act()` Warnings

**Decision**: Accept React `act()` warnings in tests

**Outcome**: ⚠️ Technical Debt

**Issues**:

- Many tests produce console warnings about updates not wrapped in `act()`
- Warnings are harmless but noisy
- Makes test output harder to read

**Why it happens**:

- Next.js components with internal state updates
- Async operations in components
- Intersection observer hooks

**Future Fix**:

- Wrap async operations properly
- Use `waitFor` from Testing Library
- Clean up test output

**Lesson**: Don't ignore test warnings; they indicate potential issues.

## Deployment Challenges

### GitHub Pages Base Path

**Challenge**: Images and assets don't load on GitHub Pages deployment

**Root Cause**: GitHub Pages serves the site at `/FFC_Single_Page_Template/` instead of `/`

**Solution**:

1. Created `assetPath()` helper in `src/lib/assetPath.ts`
2. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` environment variable in CI
3. Updated all image references to use `assetPath()`

**Lesson**: Always test deployment environment early. Localhost != production.

### CNAME and Custom Domain

**Challenge**: Need to support both GitHub Pages URL and custom domain

**Solution**:

- Created `public/CNAME` file for custom domain
- Configured DNS appropriately
- Both URLs work correctly

**Lesson**: Document deployment configurations clearly for future reference.

### Workflow Optimization

**Challenge**: Single monolithic workflow did build, test, and deploy

**Solution**:

- Split into separate `ci.yml` and `deploy.yml`
- CI runs on all PRs and pushes (fast feedback)
- Deploy only runs on main branch push
- Lighthouse runs after deployment

**Benefits**:

- Faster PR feedback
- Clearer separation of concerns
- Can test without deploying

**Lesson**: Separate workflows improve developer experience.

## Testing Insights

### Jest Setup Complexity

**Challenge**: Configuring Jest for Next.js + TypeScript + React

**Solution**: Used `next/jest` configuration helper

**Key Learnings**:

- Let Next.js handle the heavy lifting
- Don't fight the framework
- Use recommended configurations

### Accessibility Testing

**Challenge**: Manual accessibility testing is time-consuming

**Solution**: Integrated `jest-axe` for automated a11y testing

**Results**:

- Found 6 violations in Header and Footer
- Fixed all violations
- Now testing 3 critical components
- Prevents regressions

**Lesson**: Automate accessibility testing. It's too important to skip.

### E2E Test Stability

**Challenge**: E2E tests can be flaky

**Current Approach**:

- Use explicit waits
- Test critical user paths only
- Keep tests simple and focused
- Run in CI before deployment

**Lesson**: E2E tests should test happy paths, not every edge case.

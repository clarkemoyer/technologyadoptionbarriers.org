            Free For Charity accepts a wide range of donations, subject to the following criteria:
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-[26px] text-[#333] pb-[10px] leading-[26px] font-[500]">
            1. Cash Donations
          </h2>

          <p className="text-[14px] text-[#666] pb-[10px] leading-[24px] font-[500]">
            Cash donations, including checks and electronic transfers, are accepted and encouraged.
            Donors may make contributions through our online platform, by mail, or in person. These
            donations provide immediate support for our various programs and initiatives, allowing
            us to respond quickly to emerging needs.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-[26px] text-[#333] pb-[10px] leading-[26px] font-[500]">
            2. Securities
          </h2>

          <p className="text-[14px] text-[#666] pb-[10px] leading-[24px] font-[500]">
            Free For Charity accepts publicly traded securities and other forms of marketable
            securities. Donations of securities will be liquidated promptly upon receipt unless
            otherwise directed by the Board of Directors. This ensures that the value of the
            donation can be utilized effectively to support our mission. Donors are encouraged to
            consult with their financial advisors to understand the potential tax benefits of
            donating securities.
          </p>

          </h2>

          <p className="text-[14px] text-[#666] pb-[10px] leading-[24px] font-[500]">
            Donations of real estate will be considered on a case-by-case basis. The organization
            will conduct a thorough evaluation, including environmental assessments, title searches,
            and market analyses, to determine the suitability and potential liabilities associated
            with the property. Real estate donations can provide significant support for our
            long-term sustainability and growth, but it is essential to ensure that the property
            aligns with our mission and does not pose undue financial or legal risks.
          </p>

            Tangible personal property, such as art, antiques, and vehicles, may be accepted if
            deemed useful to the organization’s mission or if the property can be sold for financial
            gain. Donors are encouraged to provide a detailed description and valuation of the
            property to facilitate the acceptance process. Personal property donations can enhance
            our fundraising efforts and provide unique opportunities for donor engagement.

            In-kind contributions, including goods and services, are accepted if they fulfill the
            needs of the organization and align with our mission. Donors are encouraged to contact
            us in advance to discuss the specifics of their in-kind donation. These contributions
            can help reduce operational costs and provide essential resources for our programs.

## How GitHub Surfaces These Files

### Automatic Detection

1. **Repository root** (`/`)
2. **`.github` directory** (`/.github/`)
3. **`docs` directory** (`/docs/`) (for some files)

### Navigation Display Priority

GitHub displays files in this order:

1. README (always first)
2. Code of conduct
3. Contributing
4. License
5. Security
6. Additional files in "More" dropdown

### Mobile vs Desktop Display

- **Mobile**: Bottom navigation tabs with "More" dropdown
- **Desktop**: Sidebar links and repository navigation

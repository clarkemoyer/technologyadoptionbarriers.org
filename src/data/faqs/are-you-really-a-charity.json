  "question": "Are you really a Charity?",
  "answer": "Yes, We have had IRS designation since 2014 and have been building our systems and testing or support for several years. While charities for charities are rare they do exist and in fact fill an important need in reducing overhead expenses for other nonprofits. Our IRS designation number (EIN) is 46-2471893. You can see our guidestar profile here. We are proud to also recommend other charities for charities that inspired us to create this nonprofit."

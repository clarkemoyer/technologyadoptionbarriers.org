  "question": "What is the organization aiming to accomplish?",
  "answer": "While in the technical process of setting up free charity hosting we discovered that many small or new organizations are stuck well below the need for full web hosting. As an example, assistance with setting up a charity email address with Microsoft at the charity's domain name is needed as a first step. FFC has refactored our charity on-boarding process to address email and other basic communication needs with free guides hosted on our project site ffcdomains.org.\n\nAs a follow-on need, we identified that most charities and pre 501c3 non-profits do not create an email because they fear buying the wrong domain name or do not want to pay for a domain name. We now cover these costs and help with buying the domain name for supported charities."

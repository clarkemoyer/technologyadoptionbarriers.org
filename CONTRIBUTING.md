## AI-Assisted Development

We encourage the use of AI tools, particularly **GitHub Copilot**, to enhance the quality and efficiency of contributions to this project.

### GitHub Copilot for Issue-to-PR Workflow

We prefer using GitHub Copilot's issue-to-PR functionality for creating pull requests. This approach helps to:

- Generate consistent, well-structured code changes
- Ensure comprehensive coverage of the issue requirements
- Reduce manual coding errors
- Accelerate the development process

**To use Copilot for creating PRs from issues:**

1. Navigate to an issue in the repository.
2. Assign Copilot to the issue by selecting `copilot` from the "Assignees" dropdown in the issue sidebar. This is the primary way to invoke Copilot from the GitHub UI.
3. Copilot will automatically analyze the issue and generate a proposed pull request with code changes.
4. Review the generated code changes in the PR before requesting human review.

For more details, see [GitHub's documentation on using Copilot to work on issues](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-for-common-tasks/use-copilot-to-create-or-update-issues).

### Copilot-Based Code Reviews

**All code submissions should undergo Copilot-based reviews.** Contributors should:

1. Request a Copilot code review on your pull request by selecting Copilot as a reviewer from the "Reviewers" dropdown, or by commenting `@copilot review` on the PR. For more details, see [GitHub Copilot Code Review documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/code-review/using-copilot-code-review).
2. Review all comments and suggestions provided by Copilot.
3. Address relevant feedback (use your judgment—not all suggestions may apply to the project context).
4. Re-run the Copilot review after making changes.
5. Repeat this process until no additional actionable comments remain.
6. Then request human reviewer approval.

This iterative review process helps ensure that:

- Code quality is higher
- Coding standards are consistently adhered to
- Potential issues are detected early
- Code changes are comprehensively documented

### Best Practices for Using GitHub Copilot

Follow these best practices when using GitHub Copilot:

1. **Review all suggestions carefully** - Never blindly accept Copilot suggestions; always verify the code is correct and appropriate
2. **Provide clear context** - Write descriptive comments and function names to help Copilot generate better suggestions
3. **Use Copilot Chat for explanations** - Ask Copilot to explain complex code or suggest improvements
4. **Verify security implications** - Review generated code for potential security vulnerabilities
5. **Test generated code thoroughly** - Always test Copilot-generated code before committing
6. **Keep suggestions contextual** - Ensure generated code follows the project's existing patterns and conventions
7. **Use inline suggestions wisely** - Accept partial suggestions when they're helpful, modify or reject when they're not
8. **Leverage Copilot for documentation** - Use it to generate JSDoc comments, README updates, and code documentation

### Accessing Multiple AI Models in GitHub Copilot (VS Code)

GitHub Copilot in VS Code provides access to multiple advanced AI models—including **OpenAI GPT-4**, **Google Gemini**, and **Anthropic Claude**—directly through GitHub's infrastructure. You do not need to integrate external AI providers or supply your own API keys; model selection is managed within Copilot's interface.

#### Model Selection and Availability

You can choose among available AI models using Copilot's model selector feature. The specific models offered depend on your subscription tier and GitHub's current offerings.

1. **Install GitHub Copilot Chat Extension**
   - Ensure you have the GitHub Copilot Chat extension installed in VS Code
   - Sign in with your GitHub account that has Copilot access

2. **Access Model Selection**
   - Open the Copilot Chat panel in VS Code
   - Look for the model selector dropdown (typically at the bottom of the chat input)
   - Available models may include GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, and others depending on your subscription tier

3. **Using Claude Models**
   - Select a Claude model from the model picker (availability depends on subscription tier)
   - Claude excels at detailed code explanations, complex refactoring, and nuanced code reviews
   - Use for tasks requiring deep reasoning about code architecture

4. **Using OpenAI Models**
   - GPT-4 and GPT-4o models are the primary models available through Copilot (availability depends on subscription tier)
   - Particularly effective for general coding tasks and broad language support
   - Good for quick iterations and code completion

5. **Using Google Gemini Models**
   - Gemini models may be accessed through the Copilot interface (availability depends on subscription tier)
   - Strong performance on multi-modal tasks and code understanding
   - Useful for analyzing code alongside documentation or images

#### Best Practices for Multi-Model Usage

- **Match the model to the task** - Different models have different strengths; experiment to find what works best for specific tasks
- **Maintain consistency** - When working on a single feature, try to use the same model for consistency
- **Compare outputs** - For critical code changes, consider getting suggestions from multiple models
- **Document your approach** - If you use a specific model for a particular type of task, note it in PR descriptions for team awareness

#### VS Code Configuration Tips

```json
// Example VS Code settings for Copilot (settings.json)
// Adjust languages based on your project needs
{
  "github.copilot.enable": {
    "*": true,
    "typescript": true,
    "typescriptreact": true
  }
}
```

**Note:** Access to alternative AI providers may require specific subscription tiers. GitHub Copilot Individual provides access to core models, while GitHub Copilot Business and Enterprise may offer additional model options. Check your GitHub Copilot subscription details and the [GitHub Copilot documentation](https://docs.github.com/copilot) for currently available models.

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript/JavaScript

- Use **TypeScript** for all new files
- Follow **functional programming** principles where possible
- Use **arrow functions** for component definitions
- Prefer **const** over **let**, avoid **var**
- Use **meaningful variable names** that describe their purpose

### React Components

- Use **functional components** with hooks
- Keep components **small and focused** (single responsibility)
- Use **TypeScript interfaces** for props and state
- Place **"use client"** directive at the top when client-side features are needed
- Organize components in the appropriate directory:
  - `/src/components` - Shared/reusable components
  - `/src/app` - Page-specific components

### Styling

- Use **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- Follow a **mobile-first** approach
- Use **existing Tailwind classes** before creating custom CSS
- Group related classes together for readability
- Use consistent spacing and sizing scales

Example:

```tsx
// Good
<div className="flex flex-col gap-4 p-6 bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900">Title</h2>
  <p className="text-gray-600">Content</p>
</div>

// Avoid inline styles
<div style={{ padding: '24px' }}> // ❌
```

### File Organization

- One component per file
- Name files using **PascalCase** for components: `MyComponent.tsx`
- Name files using **camelCase** for utilities: `assetPath.ts`
- Keep related files together in directories
- Use `index.tsx` for directory exports when appropriate

---

## Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests

- Write tests for all new components and utilities
- Place tests in `__tests__` directory, mirroring the source structure
- Name test files: `ComponentName.test.tsx` or `utilityName.test.ts`
- Use **Jest** and **React Testing Library**
- Aim for meaningful test coverage, not just high percentages

#### Writing Good Tests

```tsx
// Good test structure
describe('ComponentName', () => {
  it('should render correctly', () => {
    render(<ComponentName />)
    expect(screen.getByRole('heading')).toBeInTheDocument()
  })

  it('should handle user interaction', () => {
    render(<ComponentName />)
    fireEvent.click(screen.getByRole('button'))
    expect(screen.getByText('Updated')).toBeInTheDocument()
  })
})
```

### E2E Tests

- Write E2E tests for critical user flows
- Place E2E tests in the `tests` directory
- Use **Playwright** for E2E testing
- Test across different viewports when relevant

### Test Coverage Goals

- **Current**: 26 unit tests passing (4 test suites)
- **Minimum**: 5% overall coverage (current threshold)
- **Target**: 15-20% coverage for initial implementation
- **Long-term goal**: 50%+ coverage

---

## Commit Message Guidelines

We follow a conventional commit message format to maintain a clear and organized git history.

### Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring without changing functionality
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks, dependency updates
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `ci`: CI/CD changes

### Examples

```bash
# Feature addition
git commit -m "feat: add dark mode toggle component"

# Bug fix
git commit -m "fix: resolve mobile navigation menu not closing"

# Documentation
git commit -m "docs: update README with new deployment instructions"

# Multiple lines
git commit -m "feat: implement user authentication

- Add login component
- Add logout functionality
- Add protected route wrapper
- Update navigation to show user status"
```

### Guidelines

- Use the **imperative mood** ("add" not "added" or "adds")
- Keep the subject line under **50 characters**
- Capitalize the subject line
- Do not end the subject line with a period
- Use the body to explain **what** and **why**, not **how**
- Reference issues and pull requests when relevant

### Automated Validation

**Git hooks are configured to enforce code quality standards:**

- **Pre-commit hook**: Runs before every commit
  - Checks code formatting with Prettier
  - Runs ESLint to catch errors
  - Prevents commits with formatting or linting issues
- **Commit-msg hook**: Validates commit message format
  - Enforces conventional commit format
  - Ensures commit messages follow the type format above
  - Prevents commits with improperly formatted messages

**If a hook fails:**

```bash
# Fix formatting issues
npm run format

# Check linting
npm run lint

# If you need to bypass hooks in an emergency (NOT RECOMMENDED)
git commit --no-verify -m "your message"
```

**Note**: Husky git hooks are automatically installed when you run `npm install`.

   npm run test:e2e
   ```

2. **Update documentation** if needed:
   - Update README.md for new features
   - Add JSDoc comments to new functions
   - Update TESTING.md for new test approaches

3. **Verify the build works**:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run preview
   ```

4. **Commit all changes** with proper commit messages

5. **Rebase on main** to ensure a clean history:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

### Creating a Pull Request

1. **Push your branch** to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
All right.

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's dive in.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.320
Today, we're talking about a brand new research project that's aimed at cracking one of the

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.400
toughest, most expensive problems in the business world.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.760
I mean, we've all seen this happen, right?

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:18.320
A company sinks millions into some shiny new system, a new platform, a new set of tools,

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.180
and it just fizzles.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:26.200
It gets bogged down, people resist it, and it never quite delivers on that big promise.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:31.080
It's a massive, frustrating issue that hits pretty much every organization out there.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.080
And let's be clear.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.920
The stakes here are incredibly high.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.720
As Clark Moyer, who's leading this project, puts it, this isn't just about wasted cash.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.760
When you fail to adopt new tech, you risk losing your competitive edge, and in the

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.440
worst case scenario, you could become obsolete.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.120
Now, you might be thinking, haven't people studied this for years?

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.480
And yeah, they have.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.600
But here's the thing.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.240
A lot of that research is siloed, or it just doesn't capture the big picture view from

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.680
the senior leaders who are actually making these multi-million dollar calls.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.920
There's a huge blind spot in our understanding.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.880
So if the old playbooks aren't cutting it anymore, how do you actually design something

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.140
that gets to the real root of the problem?

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.120
You go straight to the source.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.000
The tabs project hones in on the C-suite and the senior execs, you know, the CEOs,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.120
the CIOs, the folks who have that 30,000-foot view of everything happening in their

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.280
C-suite.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.120
And this is the tool they built to do it.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.440
It's called the Technology Adoption Barrier Survey, or TABs for short.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.120
It's a new diagnostic specifically designed to pull out those high-level insights and

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.840
really map out what's going on.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.640
Okay, so let's pop the hood on this thing.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.680
How does this survey actually dig in and uncover these insights?

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.760
Well, it's all broken down into a three-part diagnostic.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:54.040
To really get the full picture, it deconstructs the problem into three logical chunks.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.040
First, you've got to pinpoint the actual barriers.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.680
Next, you assess how ready the organization is for the change.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.760
And finally, you measure the maturity of the company's core processes.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.080
Let's dig into each one.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.480
Part one is all about finding the roadblocks.

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.840
It gets leaders to rate all those classic hurdles.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.520
You know the ones, employees digging their heels in, the sticker shock of the new

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.440
tech, the nightmare of making it play nice with your old systems.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.440
Or maybe it's something bigger, like nobody even knows what the strategy is.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.760
These are the pain points we all recognize.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.400
But you know, just spotting the problems isn't enough.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.280
Part two is all about readiness.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.600
Is your organization actually set up to handle this change?

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.040
Is the vision from the top crystal clear?

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.800
Is your culture open to trying new things?

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.240
Do you have the right people with the right skills?

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.840
This part is basically a checkup on your capacity for success.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.600
And this brings us to the third and maybe the most powerful part, measuring maturity.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.640
This goes way deeper than readiness.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.560
It asks leaders to rate their organization's processes on this five-level scale.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.240
Are you at level one, where everything is kind of chaotic and reactive?

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.360
Or are you all the way up at level five?

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.600
Or you're proactively innovating and always improving?

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.600
This really gets to the heart of how ingrained your good habits are.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.960
Now, a tool this ambitious can't just appear out of thin air, right?

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.720
It needs to be built on something solid.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.000
And the TABS project is absolutely built on a mountain of foundational research.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
This is what's so important to understand.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.960
The TABS survey isn't just some random checklist someone dreamed up.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:41.160
It's the end results of over 60 years of deep academic work on how people,

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.400
and by extension entire organizations, adopt new stuff.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.240
You can literally trace the family tree of these ideas.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.480
It started way back in the 60s with the diffusion of innovations theory.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.640
Then in the 80s, we got the technology acceptance model,

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.120
which focused on whether people thought something was useful and easy.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.600
The unified theory in 2003 pulled a bunch of these ideas together.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.160
And now, TABS is taking all of that and

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.000
turning it into a practical, modern tool for today's leaders.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.760
So, we've got all this history, all this research.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.760
But what's the point of collecting all this data?

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.600
Well, the goal isn't just to write another paper.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.640
It's to turn all of that data into insights you can actually use.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.400
Yeah, the whole project was built from the very beginning to have

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.760
practical real world value.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.320
It's all about closing that gap between a dusty academic theory and

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.160
the tough decisions leaders have to make every single day.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.640
So what's the big payoff?

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.440
Well, it's huge.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.680
For starters, it's going to give you industry benchmarks so

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.040
you can finally see how you stack up.

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.120
It'll help leaders zero in on exactly where they need to focus their attention.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.840
And because they plan to do this every year,

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:58.080
it will create this amazing GPS for navigating change, spotting trends,

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.760
and helping everyone build more adaptive, innovative cultures.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.600
All right, so let's make this personal for a second.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.320
Let's turn the camera around and think about what's going on in your own organization.

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:15.120
You know, the real power of a survey like this is in the questions it forces you to ask.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.880
So think about it for your own company.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:23.080
To what extent is a play it safe risk averse culture holding you back?

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:29.080
And be honest, how mature is your ability to handle the human side of change?

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.760
Just thinking through these questions is valuable.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.400
And that really brings us to the final bottom line question.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.960
Let's just cut through all the noise for a second.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.800
In your world at your company, what is the single biggest barrier holding you back?

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.680
Is it the tech, the money, the culture, the leadership?

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.520
Because answering that, that's the first real step to actually fixing it.

# Threat Model

This document outlines the security threat model for the Free For Charity website, identifying potential security risks, trust boundaries, and mitigation strategies for our technology stack.

## Overview

The Free For Charity website is a static Next.js application deployed to GitHub Pages. As a nonprofit organization, we prioritize protecting our reputation, maintaining service availability, and ensuring the security of our community.

## System Architecture

### Components

1. **Frontend Application**
   - Next.js 16.0.7 (App Router)
   - TypeScript, React 19.2.0
   - Static site generation (`output: "export"`)
   - Client-side JavaScript

2. **Hosting and Deployment**
   - GitHub Pages (static hosting)
   - Custom domain: ffcworkingsite1.org
   - GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline

3. **Development Pipeline**
   - GitHub repository
   - npm package dependencies
   - Automated testing (Jest, Playwright)
   - Code scanning (CodeQL)
   - Dependabot security updates

4. **Third-Party Integrations**
   - Google Analytics (via Google Tag Manager)
   - External assets (images, fonts)

## Trust Boundaries

### Boundary 1: User Browser ↔ Website

**Trust Relationship**: We serve static content; users trust us to provide safe, legitimate content.

**Assets at Risk**:

- User privacy
- User device security
- Organization reputation

### Boundary 2: GitHub Repository ↔ Deployment

**Trust Relationship**: GitHub Actions automates deployment; we trust GitHub's infrastructure.

**Assets at Risk**:

- Website integrity
- Source code confidentiality
- Deployment credentials

### Boundary 3: Dependencies ↔ Application

**Trust Relationship**: We depend on npm packages; we trust the npm ecosystem and package maintainers.

**Assets at Risk**:

- Application security
- User data
- Build integrity

### Boundary 4: Developers ↔ Repository

**Trust Relationship**: Maintainers have write access; we trust them to follow security practices.

**Assets at Risk**:

- Code quality
- Security posture
- Project integrity

## Threat Analysis

### 1. Static Site Threats

#### T1.1: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Description**: Injection of malicious scripts into the website through user-generated content or compromised dependencies.

**Impact**: High - Could steal user data, deface site, redirect users to malicious sites

**Likelihood**: Low - Static site with no user input forms currently active

**Mitigations**:

- ✅ React automatically escapes output
- ✅ Next.js built-in XSS protections
- ✅ Content Security Policy headers (configured via GitHub Pages)
- ✅ Regular dependency updates via Dependabot
- ⚠️ Manual review of third-party scripts (Google Tag Manager)

**Residual Risk**: Low

#### T1.2: Content Injection via Compromised Build

**Description**: Attacker modifies source code or dependencies to inject malicious content during build.

**Impact**: Critical - Could compromise all users

**Likelihood**: Low - Strong branch protection and code review

**Mitigations**:

- ✅ Branch protection rules on main branch
- ✅ Required code reviews
- ✅ Signed commits requirement
- ✅ CodeQL scanning on all PRs
- ✅ Automated testing before deployment
- ✅ Force push blocked

**Residual Risk**: Low

### 2. Dependency Chain Attacks

#### T2.1: Malicious npm Package

**Description**: A dependency or transitive dependency contains malicious code.

**Impact**: Critical - Could execute arbitrary code during build or in user browsers

**Likelihood**: Medium - npm ecosystem is a known target

**Mitigations**:

**Residual Risk**: Medium

#### T2.2: Dependency Confusion

**Description**: Attacker publishes malicious package with same name as internal package.

**Impact**: Medium - Could compromise build pipeline

**Likelihood**: Low - No internal packages currently

**Mitigations**:

- ✅ All dependencies from public npm registry
- ✅ Package-lock.json ensures consistent versions

**Residual Risk**: Low

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline Threats

#### T3.1: GitHub Actions Workflow Manipulation

**Description**: Attacker modifies workflow files to inject malicious steps.

**Impact**: Critical - Could compromise deployment keys, source code, or deployed site

**Likelihood**: Low - Protected by branch protection

**Mitigations**:

- ✅ Workflow files protected by branch protection
- ✅ Required reviews for all changes
- ✅ Signed commits required
- ✅ Limited use of third-party actions
- ✅ Actions pinned to specific versions (where possible)

**Residual Risk**: Low

#### T3.2: Secrets Exposure

**Description**: Sensitive credentials exposed in logs, code, or artifacts.

**Impact**: High - Could allow unauthorized deployments or access

**Likelihood**: Low - No sensitive secrets currently stored

**Mitigations**:

- ✅ GitHub secrets used for any credentials
- ✅ .gitignore configured to exclude sensitive files
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks prevent accidental commits
- ✅ Public repository - no false sense of security

**Residual Risk**: Low

#### T3.3: Build Artifact Tampering

**Description**: Attacker modifies built artifacts before deployment.

**Impact**: Critical - Could serve malicious content to users

**Likelihood**: Very Low - Direct pipeline from build to deployment

**Mitigations**:

- ✅ Automated deployment pipeline (no manual steps)
- ✅ Build and deploy happen in same workflow
- ✅ GitHub Actions infrastructure security

**Residual Risk**: Very Low

### 4. GitHub Pages Hosting Threats

#### T4.1: DNS Hijacking

**Description**: Attacker compromises DNS records to redirect traffic.

**Impact**: Critical - Could phish users or damage reputation

**Likelihood**: Low - DNS provider security

**Mitigations**:

- ⚠️ DNSSEC (depends on DNS provider configuration)
- ⚠️ CAA records to restrict certificate issuance
- ✅ HTTPS enforced by GitHub Pages

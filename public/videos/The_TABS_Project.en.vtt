00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
Alright.

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's dive in.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.240
Today we're talking about a brand new research project that's aimed at cracking one of

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.280
the toughest, most expensive problems in the business world.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.720
I mean, we've all seen this happen, right?

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:18.320
A company sinks millions into some shiny new system, a new platform, a new set of tools,

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.160
and it just fizzles.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.880
It gets bogged down, people resist it, and it never quite delivers on that big

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:25.880
promise.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:31.080
It's a massive, frustrating issue that hits pretty much every organization out there.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.920
And let's be clear, the stakes here are incredibly high.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.740
As Clark Moyer, who's leading this project, puts it, this isn't just about wasted cash.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.760
When you fail to adopt new tech, you risk losing your competitive edge, and in the

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.640
worst-case scenario, you could become obsolete.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.140
Now, you might be thinking, haven't people studied this for years?

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.480
And yeah, they have.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.600
But here's the thing.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.000
A lot of that research is siloed, or it just doesn't capture the big-picture view

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.240
from the senior leaders who are actually making these multi-million-dollar calls.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.920
There's a huge blind spot in our understanding.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.880
So if the old playbooks aren't cutting it anymore, how do you actually design something

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.140
that gets to the real root of the problem?

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.120
You go straight to the source.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.740
The TABs project hones in on the C-suite and the senior execs.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.880
You know, the CEOs, the CIOs, the folks who have that 30,000-foot view of everything

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.840
happening in their organization.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.100
And this is the tool they built to do it.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.440
It's called the Technology Adoption Barrier Survey, or TABs for short.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.960
It's a new diagnostic specifically designed to pull out those high-level insights

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.880
and really map out what's going on.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.620
OK, so let's pop the hood on this thing.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.480
How does this survey actually dig in and uncover these insights?

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.780
Well, it's all broken down into a three-part diagnostic.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.900
To really get the full picture, it deconstructs the problem into three logical chunks.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.020
First, you've got to pinpoint the actual barriers.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.780
Next, you assess how ready the organization is for the change.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.580
And finally, you measure the maturity of the company's core processes.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.340
Let's dig into each one.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.540
Part one is all about finding the roadblocks.

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.960
It gets leaders to rate all those classic hurdles.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:13.960
You know the ones.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.900
Employees digging their heels in, the sticker shock of the new tech, the nightmare

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.580
of making it play nice with your old systems.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.660
Or maybe it's something bigger, like nobody even knows what the strategy is.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.020
These are the pain points we all recognize.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.640
But you know, just spotting the problems isn't enough.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.380
Part two is all about readiness.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.700
Is your organization actually set up to handle this change?

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.140
Is the vision from the top crystal clear?

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.860
Is your culture open to trying new things?

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.380
Do you have the right people with the right skills?

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.020
This part is basically a checkup on your capacity for success.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.740
And this brings us to the third and maybe the most powerful part, measuring maturity.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.760
This goes way deeper than readiness.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.640
It asks leaders to rate their organization's processes on this five-level scale.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.340
Are you at level one, where everything is kind of chaotic and reactive?

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.240
Or are you all the way up at level five, where you're proactively innovating and

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.740
always improving?

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.540
This really gets to the heart of how ingrained your good habits are.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.020
Now, a tool this ambitious can't just appear out of thin air, right?

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.780
It needs to be built on something solid.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.060
And the TABs project is absolutely built on a mountain of foundational research.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.060
This is what's so important to understand.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.020
The TABs survey isn't just some random checklist someone dreamed up.

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:41.220
It's the end results of over 60 years of deep academic work on how people,

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.420
and by extension, entire organizations, adopt new stuff.

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.260
You can literally trace the family tree of these ideas.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.500
It started way back in the 60s with the diffusion of innovations theory.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.660
Then, in the 80s, we got the technology acceptance model,

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.140
which focused on whether people thought something was useful and easy.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.620
The unified theory in 2003 pulled a bunch of these ideas together.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.140
And now, TABs is taking all of that and

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.020
turning it into a practical modern tool for today's leaders.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.780
So, we've got all this history, all this research.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.780
But what's the point of collecting all this data?

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.660
Well, the goal isn't just to write another paper.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.660
It's to turn all of that data into insights you can actually use.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.420
Yeah, the whole project was built from the very beginning to have

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:30.780
factical real world value.

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.340
It's all about closing that gap between a dusty academic theory and

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.180
the tough decisions leaders have to make every single day.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.660
So what's the big payoff?

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.420
Well, it's huge.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.620
For starters, it's going to give you industry benchmarks so

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.980
you can finally see how you stack up.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.060
It'll help leaders zero in on exactly where they need to focus their attention.

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:55.260
And because they plan to do this every year, it will create this amazing GPS for

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.100
navigating change, spotting trends, and

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.700
helping everyone build more adaptive, innovative cultures.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.500
All right, so let's make this personal for a second.

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.300
Let's turn the camera around and

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.220
think about what's going on in your own organization.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:14.980
The real power of a survey like this is in the questions it forces you to ask.

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.740
So think about it for your own company.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.960
To what extent is a play it safe risk averse culture holding you back?

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.260
And be honest, how mature is your ability to handle the human side of

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.780
change?

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.580
Just thinking through these questions is valuable.

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.260
And that really brings us to the final bottom line question.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.820
Let's just cut through all the noise for a second.

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:39.780
In your world, at your company,

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.780
what is the single biggest barrier holding you back?

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.620
Is it the tech, the money, the culture, the leadership?

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.460
Because answering that, that's the first real step to actually fixing it.

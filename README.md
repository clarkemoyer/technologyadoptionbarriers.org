## About This Repository

This repository contains the **Technology Adoption Barriers (TABS)** website - a comprehensive research platform documenting technology adoption challenges and providing resources for organizations navigating technology change.

### Academic Research Foundation

**TABS is a Culminating Research Project (CRP) for the Smeal College of Business Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) program** at Penn State University. This research initiative is led by **Clarke Moyer** as the primary researcher, with a scheduled CRP defense on **May 7, 2026**. A CRP is similar to a dissertation but is specific to doctoral programs (as distinct from PhD programs, which use the term "dissertation").

The project represents rigorous academic research into technology adoption barriers, combining theoretical frameworks with practical insights to advance both scholarly understanding and real-world applications. The DBA program at Smeal emphasizes applied research that bridges the gap between academic theory and business practice, making TABS an ideal platform for disseminating research findings while providing actionable resources for organizations.

### Mission

TABS focuses on understanding and addressing barriers that individuals, businesses, and organizations face when adopting new technologies, including cost, complexity, lack of awareness, fear of change, compatibility issues, infrastructure limitations, skill gaps, and security concerns.

- ✅ **NavBar Logo Visibility**: Verifies logo appears in top left corner with correct src and alt text
- ✅ **Hero Section Logo Visibility**: Verifies logo appears in hero section with correct src and alt text
- ✅ **Logo Consistency**: Confirms both logos are present simultaneously and use the same image source

**GitHub Pages Deployment Tests** (`tests/github-pages.spec.ts`)

- ✅ **Image Path Compatibility**: Validates logo image paths work for both custom domain and GitHub Pages basePath
- ✅ **Image HTTP Status**: Verifies logo images return 200 OK status codes
- ⏭️ **Image Natural Dimensions** (skipped): Checks image dimensions after load (disabled in CI due to timing issues)

**Test Configuration** (`playwright.config.ts`)

### Static Code Analysis

**ESLint** (`eslint.config.mjs`)

- ✅ Next.js core-web-vitals and TypeScript rules enabled
- ✅ Runs automatically during build process
- ⚠️ Currently reports 16 warnings - see details below

**ESLint Warning Details:**

The ESLint warnings fall into three categories:

1. **`@next/next/no-img-element` warnings (6 occurrences)** - ⚠️ ACCEPTABLE for this project
   - Files: `header/index.tsx`, `footer/index.tsx`, `endowment-fund/Hero/index.tsx`, `free-charity-web-hosting/About-FFC-Hosting/index.tsx`, `ui/General-Donation-Card.tsx`, `ui/trainingcard.tsx`
   - Issue: Using `<img>` tags instead of Next.js `<Image />` component
   - Why acceptable: This project uses static export (`output: "export"` in `next.config.ts`), which is incompatible with Next.js Image Optimization. We use the `assetPath()` helper to ensure images work correctly on both custom domain and GitHub Pages basePath.
   - Alternative fix: Could suppress these specific warnings or migrate to a custom image component
   - Website impact: Images load correctly but without automatic optimization (WebP conversion, lazy loading). For a static nonprofit site with modest image usage, this is an acceptable tradeoff.

2. **React Hooks warnings - `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` (6 occurrences)** - ⚠️ ACCEPTABLE but could be improved
   - Files: Various accordion components (`Accordion.tsx`, `AccordionBold.tsx`, `Frequently-Asked-Questions.tsx`, `OrangeFaqItem.tsx`, `free-charity-web-hosting/FAQs/index.tsx`) and `cookie-consent/index.tsx`
   - Issue: Calling `setState` synchronously within `useEffect` when animating accordion height or loading preferences
   - Why acceptable: These components work correctly and don't cause performance issues in practice
   - Recommended fix: Use `useLayoutEffect` instead of `useEffect` for DOM measurements, or use CSS transitions with `max-height`
   - Website impact: Accordion animations work correctly. May cause minor cascading renders but not noticeable to users.

3. **React Hooks warnings - Other (4 occurrences)** - ⚠️ ACCEPTABLE but could be improved
   - `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` (2 occurrences): Missing dependencies in `useEffect`
     - Files: `free-charity-web-hosting/ClientTestimonials/index.tsx`, `ui/CallToActionCard.tsx`
     - Impact: Effects may not re-run when dependencies change, but current implementation works as intended
   - `react-hooks/immutability` (2 occurrences): Direct mutation of state values
     - Files: `free-charity-web-hosting/ClientTestimonials/index.tsx`, `home/Testimonials/index.tsx`
     - Issue: Modifying Swiper navigation params directly instead of using setter
     - Impact: Works correctly but violates React best practices
   - These are technical debt items that don't affect functionality but should be addressed in future refactoring

**Summary:**

- 6 warnings are acceptable by design (static export constraint)
- 10 warnings are technical debt that don't affect functionality
- All warnings have been reviewed and determined to be non-blocking
- Website functions correctly despite these warnings

**For detailed technical debt tracking:** See [TECHNICAL_DEBT.md](./TECHNICAL_DEBT.md) for comprehensive documentation of all technical debt items, including these React Hooks warnings, security vulnerabilities, and future refactoring plans.

**TypeScript** (`tsconfig.json`)

**🏆 Recommendation: Cloudflare Pages**

For this project, **Cloudflare Pages is a strong default choice** for these reasons:

1. **Most Likely to Stay Free Long-Term**
   - Cloudflare's business model is built on enterprise customers, not small sites
   - Unlimited bandwidth makes it sustainable even as traffic grows
   - No history of restricting free tier features

2. **Unlimited Bandwidth**
   - Vercel's 100GB/month may become restrictive as the nonprofit grows
   - Cloudflare has no bandwidth limits on free tier
   - Better for handling traffic spikes during fundraising campaigns

3. **Better Sustainability Model**
   - Cloudflare Pages is positioned as a competitive feature, not a revenue source
   - Vercel's focus on monetization through usage limits may tighten over time

4. **Good Next.js Support**
   - While Vercel created Next.js, Cloudflare Pages handles static exports excellently
   - This project uses static export (`output: "export"`), so Vercel's edge runtime advantages don't apply

**⚠️ Vercel Considerations**

Vercel is still a good option if you prioritize:

- Slightly better Next.js-specific tooling
- Simpler initial setup for Next.js projects
- Current free tier is adequate for foreseeable traffic

However, the "hobby" designation may be subject to future policy changes, and the 100GB bandwidth limit could become restrictive.

#### Workflow for Creators and Reviewers

Both platforms provide identical workflows:

**Creator:**

1. Create feature branch
2. Make changes and push to GitHub
3. Open pull request
4. Wait for automatic preview deployment (1-3 minutes)
5. Share preview URL from bot comment

**Reviewer:**

1. Open PR on GitHub
2. Click preview URL in bot comment
3. Test the live site in browser (no IDE or local setup needed)
4. Provide feedback on PR
5. Changes automatically deploy on new commits

**Coexistence with GitHub Pages:**

- Keep GitHub Pages for production (custom domain if configured)
- Use Cloudflare Pages or Vercel for PR previews only
- No conflicts between systems

#### Setting Up Cloudflare Pages (Recommended)

1. **Sign Up/Sign In**
   - Go to [pages.cloudflare.com](https://pages.cloudflare.com)
   - Sign in with GitHub (or create Cloudflare account)

2. **Connect Repository**
   - Click "Create a project" → "Connect to Git"
   - Select "GitHub" and authorize Cloudflare Pages
   - Choose this repository

3. **Configure Build Settings**
   - Framework preset: Select "Next.js (Static HTML Export)"
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Build output directory: `out`
   - Environment variables: Leave `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` unset
     - GitHub Pages with a custom domain deploys to root, no basePath needed
     - GitHub Pages without a custom domain may need `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH=/<repo-name>`

4. **Enable Preview Deployments**
   - In project settings → Builds & deployments
   - Enable "Enable automatic preview deployments" (should be on by default)
   - Enable "Enable comments on pull requests"

5. **Deploy**
   - Click "Save and Deploy"
   - First build will take 2-3 minutes
   - Future PR preview deployments are automatic

**Result**: Every PR will have a comment like:

```
✅ Preview deployed to https://abc123.preview.pages.dev
🔗 Production: https://your-site.pages.dev
```

#### Setting Up Vercel (Alternative)

If you prefer Vercel:

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign in with GitHub
2. Click "Add New..." → "Project"
3. Import this repository
4. Configure:
   - Framework Preset: Next.js
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `out`
   - Leave `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` unset
5. Deploy

Vercel automatically enables PR preview deployments and comments.

## Site Improvements & Capability Gaps

A comprehensive technical analysis comparing this repository to related sites is available in **[SITE_IMPROVEMENTS.md](./SITE_IMPROVEMENTS.md)**.

This document identifies:

- 19 technical capability gaps
- Detailed implementation guidance for each gap
- Priority recommendations and implementation roadmap
- Estimated effort and complexity for each improvement

**Key improvement opportunities:**

- CodeQL security scanning
- Unit testing with Jest
- Code formatting with Prettier
- Lighthouse CI performance monitoring
- Dark mode theming
- Enhanced documentation suite
- And more...

## Common Tasks

- Update homepage content: edit `src/app/page.tsx`
- Update components: edit files in `src/components/` directory
- Adjust SEO: edit `metadata` in `src/app/layout.tsx`
- Add new pages: create new directories in `src/app/` with `page.tsx` files
- Update sitemap: edit `src/app/sitemap.ts` when adding new pages

## Deployment Details

The site is configured for static export and deployed to GitHub Pages:

**Production:**

- Live at: [https://technologyadoptionbarriers.org](https://technologyadoptionbarriers.org)
- Deployment: Automatic via GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
- Trigger: Push to `main` branch
- Build output: Static files in `./out` directory

**Local preview of production build:**

```bash
npm run build    # Build static site
npm run preview  # Preview at http://localhost:3000
```

**Note:** The build process uses `output: "export"` in `next.config.ts` for static site generation compatible with GitHub Pages.

## Notes

- When adding new pages, update `sitemap.ts` to include them in the sitemap
- Static export configuration in `next.config.ts` supports GitHub Pages deployment with basePath
- Cookie consent implementation tracks user preferences in localStorage
- All images use `unoptimized` setting for static export compatibility
- ESLint warnings about `<img>` tags are expected and acceptable for static export configuration

  "question": "How can I participate in TABS research?",
  "answer": "You can get involved with TABS in several ways: participate in the annual survey to share your organization's experiences, contribute financially to support continued research, volunteer your expertise to help with research and analysis, or become a sponsor to enable broader research initiatives. All contributions help advance understanding of technology adoption challenges and solutions. Note: TABS is not a 501(c)(3) organization, so contributions are not tax-deductible as charitable donations."
